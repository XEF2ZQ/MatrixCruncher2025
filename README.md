MatrixCruncher2025


MatrixCruncher2025 is a comprehensive Python application that provides a suite of matrix operations, numerical methods, and CPU benchmarking tools. Built with a user-friendly GUI using Tkinter, it integrates powerful numerical libraries like NumPy, SciPy, Numba, and Matplotlib to offer efficient and accelerated computations.

🚀 Key Features:
	•	⚡ Blazing-Fast Matrix Multiplication with Numba acceleration
	•	🔍 LU Decomposition powered by parallel computing
	•	📈 Real-Time Linear Regression with instant plotting
	•	🔢 Lagrange Interpolation for precise data fitting
	•	📊 Powerful Least Squares Solver for large datasets
	•	🎯 PDF Analysis with expected value, variance & more
	•	💪 CPU Benchmarks for intense floating-point & integer performance


The application uses Numba's JIT compilation and parallel processing to accelerate computations.
When running benchmarks, especially with large sizes, ensure your system has adequate resources.
Error handling is implemented to manage invalid inputs and ensure the application remains responsive.
